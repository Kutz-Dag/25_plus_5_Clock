# 25 Plus 5 Clock with React

### Description
Creating a 25+5 Clock for a freeCodeCamp Project. The purpose of the project is to create a functional clock that records "Work time" and "Break time" using the React.js framework.

### The calculator should look similar to this:

> I used React.js as my JavaScript framework to create this project, along with HTML and CSS.

### What was the aim?
* The clock should work
* You should be able to edit the length of the breaks
* You should be able to edit the length of the sessions
* There should be a "play or pause" button
* There should be a "reset" button
* It must be built with React.js

### User tests/stories to pass:
